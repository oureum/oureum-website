# Positioning & Design Principles

## 3.1 Positioning
Oureum is positioned as a compliance-native blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for regulated finance and real-world assets (RWAs). Unlike general-purpose blockchains that leave compliance, KYC, and AML processes to off-chain intermediaries, Oureum integrates these mechanisms directly at the protocol layer.

This positioning allows Oureum to serve three primary stakeholder groups:
*   **Financial Institutions & Banks** – requiring regulatory clarity, auditability, and full control of compliance gates.
*   **Enterprises & Governments** – seeking a blockchain environment aligned with national and international financial laws.
*   **Individuals & Developers** – who benefit from a secure, transparent ecosystem where compliant products can be built and adopted at scale.

In essence, Oureum is not just “another chain,” but a compliance-first financial infrastructure enabling tokenized assets (like OUMG) to achieve institutional trust and mainstream adoption.

## 3.2 Design Principles
Oureum is engineered based on the following principles:

### Compliance by Design
*   Compliance is not an add-on; it is embedded at the protocol level.
*   Integrated modules handle KYC, AML, and jurisdictional rules, ensuring institutions can confidently operate on-chain.

### Security First
*   Consensus, bridges, custody, and oracles are designed with strict security guarantees.
*   Multi-signature policies, validator slashing, and circuit breakers are integral to the protocol.

### Interoperability
*   Native bridges and cross-chain standards ensure seamless asset transfers across ecosystems (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.).
*   Designed to integrate with CBDCs and tokenized deposits.

### Auditable Transparency
*   All reserves (OUMG) are provable in real-time via on-chain proofs.
*   Governance decisions, compliance rule updates, and treasury management are fully traceable on-chain.

### Selective Permissioning (“Open where possible; restricted where required”)
*   General users can transact freely within the compliance framework.
*   Specific transactions (e.g., high-value settlements, bank-issued assets) are subject to selective permissioning, balancing openness with institutional requirements.

### User Privacy with Accountability
*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is never stored on-chain.
*   Zero-knowledge proofs and hashed attestations are used to prove compliance without disclosing private data.
