# Go-To-Market (Institutions & Banks)

## 14.1 Integration Models for Banks
We propose three collaboration pathways for banks and financial institutions:

### Direct Issuance under OUMG (Preferred Model)
*   Banks adopt OUMG as the standard gold-backed stablecoin.
*   They integrate with Oureum’s custody & compliance layer for issuance and redemption.
*   **Benefits**: unified liquidity, brand consistency, and simplified compliance reporting.

### Co-Branded Series
*   Banks issue a co-branded version of OUMG (e.g., OUMG-Affin Series).
*   Technically, this remains the same contract, but with tagged metadata for bank-managed allocations.
*   **Benefits**: banks maintain brand identity while ensuring interoperability.

### White-Label Lines
*   Banks issue their own gold tokens on Oureum Network using the compliance modules.
*   Oureum provides the infrastructure; banks manage branding and customer relationships.
*   **Benefits**: maximum flexibility for banks, with compliance built-in.

## 14.2 API & Console for Banks
To facilitate integration, Oureum provides:

### KYC Onboarding API
*   Allows banks to directly onboard their customers with existing eKYC systems.
*   Supports issuance of verifiable credentials compatible with Oureum’s compliance layer.

### Funding & Reconciliation APIs
*   **Fiat on/off ramps**: APIs for banks to map fiat deposits/withdrawals to OUMG mint/burn events.
*   **Daily reconciliation tools**: ensure circulating OUMG matches fiat/gold balances.

### Regulatory Reporting APIs
*   Generate STR/SAR, tax reports, and compliance attestations automatically.
*   Plug-and-play dashboards for banks’ compliance departments.

## 14.3 Use Cases for Institutional Adoption

### Treasury Management
*   Banks and corporates can use OUMG as a gold-denominated stable asset for reserve diversification.

### Settlement Layer
*   Faster, cheaper cross-border settlement compared to SWIFT.
*   Especially relevant for Malaysia–Singapore–Indonesia trade corridors.

### Tokenized Deposits & Commodities
*   Banks can issue tokenized gold deposits, fully compliant, with on-chain proof of reserves.

### Compliant DeFi Access
*   Banks and regulated funds can interact with compliant liquidity pools, using OUMG as collateral or settlement currency.

## 14.4 Southeast Asia Market Strategy
*   **Malaysia First**: Position OUMG as the first MiCA-ready gold stablecoin in Malaysia, aligned with BNM requirements.
*   **Singapore Expansion**: Partner with local exchanges and MAS sandbox participants for liquidity.
*   **ASEAN Hub**: Build settlement corridors (Malaysia–Singapore–Indonesia–Thailand) to establish OUMG as the de facto regional digital gold standard.
