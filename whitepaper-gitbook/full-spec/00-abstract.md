# Abstract

Oureum Network is a next-generation blockchain ecosystem purpose-built to bridge the gap between decentralized technology and regulated financial markets. Unlike traditional public blockchains that rely on off-chain intermediaries for compliance, Oureum integrates regulatory controls, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) safeguards, and institutional oversight directly at the protocol layer.

The network is powered by OUREUM, its native utility token for gas, staking, and governance. Complementing this is Oureum Gold (OUMG), a gold-backed stablecoin pegged 1:1 to physical grams of LBMA-standard gold, securely stored in audited vaults. OUMG is transparently redeemable in both fiat and physical gold, delivering stability and trust to users.

By combining a compliance-first infrastructure with a tangible, gold-backed digital currency, Oureum establishes a secure and institutionally viable blockchain environment. This dual-layered design enables banks, enterprises, and governments to adopt blockchain confidently, while offering individuals and businesses a transparent, globally transferable, and inflation-resistant store of value.
