# Regulatory & Legal Framework

## 13.1 AML/CFT Alignment
*   **Integrated AML Layer**:
    *   All transactions screened against global sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, EU, BNM).
    *   On-chain risk scoring engine applies jurisdiction-specific transfer rules.
*   **CFT Compliance**:
    *   Mechanisms to detect and block suspicious patterns (structuring, layering, smurfing).
    *   Integration with Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) workflows, allowing flagged events to be escalated to relevant authorities.

## 13.2 Sanctions Compliance & Reporting
*   **Automated Sanctions Checks**: Before a transaction is finalized, the compliance engine validates addresses against continuously updated watchlists.
*   **Reporting Portal**: Authorized entities (banks, regulators) can access a regulator console for real-time monitoring and generate SAR/STR reports as required.
*   **Data Privacy**: Only hashed attestations or zk-proofs are stored on-chain; raw KYC data remains with accredited providers.

## 13.3 Jurisdictional Strategy
*   **Malaysia First**:
    *   Align with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) standards on digital assets and tokenized commodities.
    *   Position OUMG as a regulated digital gold product under securities or commodities frameworks.
*   **SEA Expansion**:
    *   **Singapore**: MAS regulatory sandbox, potential licensing as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) or Major Payment Institution (MPI).
    *   **Indonesia & Thailand**: Targeted partnerships with banks for tokenized gold savings and cross-border settlement.
*   **MiCA Readiness (EU)**:
    *   OUMG is structured to qualify as an Asset-Referenced Token (ART).
    *   Oureum Network designed to meet MiCA audit, custody, and compliance obligations.

## 13.4 Licenses & Custodial Arrangements
*   **Vault Custodians**:
    *   Licensed vaults in Malaysia (primary) and other jurisdictions (backup).
    *   Full insurance coverage for stored gold bars.
*   **Audit & Attestation**:
    *   Independent audit firms provide monthly reserve reports.
    *   Real-time Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) posted on-chain.
*   **Licenses**:
    *   Seek licensing under digital commodity/tokenized asset frameworks where available.
    *   Long-term plan: regulated Digital Asset Exchange (DAX) license in Malaysia to facilitate direct buy/sell in fiat.

## 13.5 Disclaimers & Risk Factors
*   **Regulatory Risk**: Future changes in law may affect token issuance, redemption, or custody operations.
*   **Custody Risk**: Although insured, gold custodians remain a third-party dependency.
*   **Bridge Risk**: Cross-chain interoperability introduces additional vectors for compliance leakage; mitigated by compliance-gated bridges.
*   **User Responsibility**: OUM/OUMG usage is subject to compliance rules; non-compliant transfers may be blocked or reversed.
