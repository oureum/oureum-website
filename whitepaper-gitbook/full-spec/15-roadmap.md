# Roadmap

The Oureum roadmap is structured in phases, aligning with both technical milestones and regulatory readiness. As of September 2025, the project is transitioning from proof-of-concept to its Q4 2025 foundation phase.

## Phase 0 – Proof-of-Concept (Completed, Q3 2025)
*   Private testnet launched on PoA consensus.
*   Native token OUREUM deployed for gas + governance testing.
*   OUMG demo contract (ERC-20) deployed, pegged 1g = 1 OUMG.
*   Basic admin web (demo): mint/burn functions, gold pricing input.
*   Internal testing of compliance modules (mock KYC + transaction filters).

## Phase 1 – Foundation (Q4 2025)(Current Phase)
*   Public Testnet (PoA) live with 2–3 validator nodes.
*   Integration of gas price policy (1 gwei = baseline) for predictable costs.
*   Admin Console v1: gold pricing, mint/burn management, activity logs.
*   User Wallet App v1:
    *   MetaMask login
    *   View OUM & OUMG balances
    *   Redeem simulation (cash/gold)
    *   Begin collaboration with vault partner in Malaysia (BNM price oracle feed).
    *   Start monthly proof-of-reserve attestations (mock).

## Phase 2 – Growth (Q1–Q2 2026)
*   Mainnet (Layer 2) launched with OP Stack or zkRollup architecture.
*   Transition from PoA → PoS validator set (staked OUREUM).
*   Compliance Layer v1 activated: verifiable credentials + sanctions screening.
*   OUMG Stablecoin Mainnet Release: 1:1 gold-backed with custodian attestation.
*   Redemption App v2: fiat redemption rails integrated (bank pilot).
*   First institutional partnerships onboarded (banks / fintechs in Malaysia & SEA).

## Phase 3 – Expansion (Q3–Q4 2026)
*   Regulator Dashboard v1: secure oversight console for compliance authorities.
*   Interoperability Bridges: Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain (OUMG cross-chain).
*   Liquidity Pools (DEX/CEX listings) for OUMG with fiat pairs (MYR, USD).
*   Governance DAO v1: OUREUM stakers vote on protocol upgrades, vault policies.
*   Expansion to multi-jurisdictional vaults (Singapore, Switzerland).

## Phase 4 – Institutional Adoption (2027 and beyond)
*   MiCA certification for EU compliance (through Tokeny-style framework).
*   Launch of white-label programs with banks (e.g., “Affin Gold” powered by Oureum).
*   Full compliance SDK release for financial institutions.
*   OUMG is accepted in institutional DeFi protocols (lending, settlement, RWA tokenization).
*   Global roll-out: SE Asia first, followed by EU and MENA region.
