# Token Economics

Oureum network adopts a dual-token model consisting of:
*   **OUREUM (native utility token)**
    *   Used for gas/transaction fee utility, staking, and governance.
    *   Incentivizes validators and funds the ecosystem.
    *   Act as collateral/Stablecoin anchor for minting a stablecoin.
*   **OUMG (gold-backed stablecoin)**
    *   1 OUMG = 1 gram of LBMA-certified gold.
    *   Fully redeemable, non-inflationary, and used for settlement and value storage.

## 10.1 OUREUM (Native Token)
*   **Total Supply**: 1 billion OUREUM.
*   **Initial Circulation**: 150 million OUREUM (15%)
*   **Staking APY**: 15% (decreasing 3% yearly)
*   **Burn Rate**: 30% of transaction fees
*   **Treasury Allocation**: 15% of all fees + 5% block rewards
*   **Repurchase**: 10% of profit to buyback OUREUM and burn annually with cap at 500 million total supply
*   **Inflation**: Low annual inflation (1–2%) to incentivize validators after staking launch.
*   **Use Cases**:
    *   Pay gas fees on the network.
    *   Stake to secure the chain (once PoS on L2).
    *   Participate in governance (DAO proposals, compliance rule approvals, treasury votes).
*   **Fee Burn**: A portion of OUREUM spent on gas fees will be burned to reduce inflationary pressure.

## 10.2 OUMG (Gold-Backed Stablecoin)
*   **Backing**: Fully backed 1:1 with LBMA-standard gold.
*   **Supply Dynamics**:
    *   **Minting**: Triggered when KYC’d users purchase gold-backed tokens.
    *   **Burning**: When users redeem OUMG for physical gold or fiat.
*   **Price Stability**: Peg maintained by audited gold reserves + on-chain proof-of-reserve smart contracts.
*   **Inflation**: None (strictly 1:1 backed).

## 10.3 Fee Flows
*   **Transaction Fees (Gas)**: Paid in OUREUM.
    *   Split between validators, treasury, and burn mechanism.
*   **OUMG Fees**:
    *   Small minting/redemption fees to cover custody & insurance costs.
    *   Buy/sell spreads managed by liquidity pools & institutional market makers.

## 10.4 Treasury Policy
*   **Treasury Sources**:
    *   % of gas fees in OUREUM.
    *   OUMG mint/burn operation fees.
*   **Uses**:
    *   Network upgrades.
    *   Custody/insurance coverage.
    *   Developer & compliance grants.
*   **Governance**:
    *   Managed by Oureum DAO (future direction).
    *   Transparent reporting and quarterly treasury disclosures.
