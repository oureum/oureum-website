# Custody, Vaulting & Proof-of-Reserves

To ensure OUMG’s credibility as a fully gold-backed stablecoin, Oureum adopts a multi-layer custody, vaulting, and auditing framework that provides real-time transparency while meeting institutional standards.

## 9.1 Vault Partners & Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy

### Primary Custodian (Malaysia)
*   Licensed local vault provider, compliant with BNM and Securities Commission standards.

### Secondary Custodians (Expansion)
*   Partner vaults in Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland to diversify jurisdictional risk.

### Vault Standards
*   Only LBMA-certified gold bars are accepted.
*   Purity ≥ 99.5%.
*   Minimum bar sizes: 50g, 100g, 1kg.

## 9.2 Insurance & Risk Mitigation
*   All vault holdings are fully insured against theft, loss, and physical damage.
*   Custodians must provide audited inventory reports monthly.
*   Smart contracts enforce that OUMG supply cannot exceed verified reserves.

## 9.3 Proof-of-Reserves (PoR)

### Monthly Third-Party Attestations
*   Independent auditors confirm total grams of gold in vaults.

### On-Chain Proofs
*   Cryptographic attestations published directly to Oureum Network.
*   Users can verify circulating OUMG supply vs. vault reserves in real-time.

### Public Dashboard
*   Real-time view of:
    *   Circulating OUMG
    *   Total gold (grams) in reserves
    *   Custodian locations
    *   Last audit timestamp

## 9.4 Reconciliation & Emergency Policy
*   **Circulating Supply = Total Audited Reserves (always enforced).**
*   **Emergency Redemption**:
    *   If Oureum or custodian fails to operate, users can redeem OUMG directly through designated trustees.
    *   DAO-controlled insurance fund backs unexpected shortfalls.
