# Ecosystem and Governance

The Oureum ecosystem will be governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (Oureum DAO). OUREUM token stakers will vote on key decisions:

*   Network parameter upgrades.
*   Treasury management (funded by a portion of gas fees).
*   Approval of new compliance rule sets.
*   Selection of audit firms and vault custodians for OUMG.
