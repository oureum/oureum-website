# The Oureum Network (Layer 2)

## 2.1. Native Token: OUREUM
*   **Function**: OUREUM is the native utility token that powers the network. It is used to:
    *   Pay for transaction fees (gas).
    *   Stake for network security via a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
    *   Govern the network through on-chain voting proposals.

## 2.2. Core Architecture & Consensus: Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Oureum utilizes a PoS consensus for energy efficiency and to allow token holders to participate in network security. Validators are required to stake OUREUM tokens to validate transactions and create new blocks.

## 2.3. The Compliance Layer: Integrated AML-A Technology
This is Oureum's unique technological breakthrough. The compliance layer is a modular, on-chain suite of protocols that interact with validated data sources.

*   **Identity Verification Module (IVM)**: Allows for optional, secure, and privacy-preserving KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. Users can obtain a verifiable credential that allows them to interact with compliant dApps without repeatedly submitting personal data.
*   **Transaction Monitoring & Analysis**: Every transaction is screened against customizable risk rules and watchlists (e.g., OFAC, global sanctions lists). Suspicious transactions can be flagged for review by authorized entities.
*   **Privacy-Centric Design**: The system is designed to minimize data exposure. Personal data is not stored on the public ledger; only zero-knowledge proofs or hashed attestations are used where necessary to prove compliance status without revealing underlying data.
*   **Regulator Dashboard**: A secure portal provides authorized regulators with a tailored view of network activity, enabling efficient oversight and audit capabilities.
